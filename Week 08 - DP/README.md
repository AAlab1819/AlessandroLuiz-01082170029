## 433B: Kuriyama Mirai's Stones
[**Problem**](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/433/B) || [**Solution**](http://codeforces.com/contest/433/submission/45112203)\
This problem is asking us to help Kuriyama Mirai has killed many monsters and got many (namely n) stones. 
She numbers the stones from 1 to n. The cost of the i-th stone is vi. 
Kuriyama Mirai wants to know something about these stones so she will ask us two kinds of questions:

She will tell you two numbers, l and r (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n), and you should tell her .
Let ui be the cost of the i-th cheapest stone (the cost that will be on the i-th place if we arrange all the stone costs in non-decreasing order). 
This time she will tell you two numbers, l and r (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n), and you should tell her .
For every question should be the correct answer

## 913C: Party Lemonade
[**Problems**](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/913/C) || [**Solution**](http://codeforces.com/contest/913/submission/45144559)\
This problems is asking us to find he cheapest cost to fullfill the lemonade liters needed.
Where each bottle have different volume and cost, the volume of the i-th bottle will be 2i-1 liters. 
You can buy more than a bottle with the same volume.
You can have more lemonade in liters than the required number.
The first line input will be number of bottle types and required lemonade in liters. 
The second line input will be the price of the i-th bottle.
The output will be the money we spend to reach the required lemonade.
