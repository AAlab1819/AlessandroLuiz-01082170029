## Find the Running Median
[**Problems**](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/ctci-find-the-running-median/problem) || **Solution** = check file FindTheRunningMedian.cpp in file week 06\
This problems is asking us to find the median in inputed list or tree. First we need to sorted the inputed list with heapsort 
and then we can search the median of the inputed list.

{6,5,4}

First input is {6}, the output will be 6 because there is no other number in the list.
Second input is {5,6}, the output will be 5.5 because (6+5)/2= 5.5.
Third input is{4,5,6}, the output will be 5, because 5 is the median of the list

**Complexity**<br>
O(nlogn)
